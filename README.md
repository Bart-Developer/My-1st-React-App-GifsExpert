# Getting Started my first React app

This app is based on searching gifs, it is an app that I used to learn React, in it I used functional components, hooks like (useState & useEffect), custom hooks, I implemented an api from (GIPHY Developers) using fetch and PostMan services to cover my needs according to what I wanted to use from the api.

For the styles I applied only CSS 3 with Flex Box , Jquery and Boostrap 5.

For the effects I applied the Animate.css service.

I hope you enjoy this simple App.

Thanks so much for reading.

Greetings, Bartolom√©.-
